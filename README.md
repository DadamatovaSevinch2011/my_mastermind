# Welcome to My Mastermind
Sevinch's Mastermind

## Task
    I had to make a mastermind game in which you have to guess a combination of 4 numbers. 
    There were no big problems, a little work was done on exiting the game with CTRL + D.
## Description
    I thought about the problem of exiting the game for a long time, but I guessed to create a global flag.
    A couple of lines and you're done (easy).
## Installation
    you just need to copy the code and paste it into the C compiler. 
    And run with makefile.
## Usage
    The application is very easy to use, someone guesses a number and writes `./my_mastermind -c "[hidden number]"`. 
    And you have to guess this number without repeating the numbers in it.
    Yes, it's complicated and because of this, small hints are given in the form of "Wellplaced pieces:", "Missplaced pieces: ".
    If you want to know how many attemps you have - you must just write in terminal `-t`.
    And if you want to exit from game just push combination in the keyboard CTRL+D;
